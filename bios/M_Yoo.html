<b>Min-Gu Yoo</b> is a postdoctoral associate research physicist at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.
He received a Ph. D. in Nuclear Engineering from Seoul National University in 2017.
His research interests include transport mechanisms of magnetic fusion plasmas, such as plasma start-up and disruption, 
and the development of computational codes based on the first-principles modeling such as the gyrokinetic particle simulations.
He has publications on plasma start-up (Nat. Commun. 9 3523 (2018)) and thermal quench physics (Nucl. Fusion 61 126036 (2021)).
He has received the awards of "Young Scientist in Plasma Physics" by the Korean Physical Society (2019) 
and the "Young Researcher Award (U40)" by the Association of Asia-Pacific Physical Societies (2021).
