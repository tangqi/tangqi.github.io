From 2018 to 2024, I was a Postdoc and later converted to a Scientist in the Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics Group ( T-5 ) in the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Prior to that, from 2015 to 2018, I was an Eliza Ricketts Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I received my Ph.D. in Applied Math from Michigan State University in 2015 and B.S. in Math & Applied Math from Zhejiang University in 2010. I am a computational scientist and applied mathematician by training. My research goal is to leverage modern computational science tools for physics applications. My research heavily relies on open-source packages such as MFEM , PETSc , p4est , Overture , and hypre for development of scalable physics codes. Additionally, I am interested in exploring scientific machine learning (SciML) in those physics applications. My primary physics interests are magnetic confinement fusion (e.g., tokamak disruption and its mitigation) and plasma physics (e.g., magnetic reconnection, MHD turbulence and plasma-based accelerators). During my career at LANL, my research was mainly supported by DOE Office of Science's Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) and Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) programs, including their joint SciDAC program. My research was also supported by several LANL Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) programs and NSF (MSGI and DMS). I have several PhD student positions in Fall 2026. The Ph.D. projects can involve one or multiple areas from the research interests listed below. If there is sufficient interest, students can undertake a summer internship at one of the DOE national labs. If you are interested in joining my team, please email me. Please note that Ph.D. students in the CSE program can have a home unit in a different school. Therefore, I am also interested in accepting students in mathematics, physics, and engineering. However, students must first be admitted by their respective home units. Therefore, if you are strongly interested in working with me, I encourage you to select CSE as your home unit.

Full cold vertical displacement event (VDE) simulation of a major disruption in an ITER-like tokamak reactor LA-UR-23-21442. Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. We consider a multi-domain quasi-static MHD model for force-free plasmas, addressing the coupling between instability in hot plasmas and the magnetic diffusion in the wall region in ITER. We develop a solver for the quasi-static force-free plasma model above.

I build upon computational techiniques such as implicit time stepping, iterative methods, adavanced preconditioning, adaptive mesh refinement, domain decompositions, and GPU accelerations. Here two recent works are presented. Scalable MFEM-based resistive MHD solver LA-UR-22-22440. Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations are continuum models used in the study of a wide range of plasma physics systems, including the evolution of complex plasma dynamics in tokamak disruptions. However, efficient numerical solution methods for MHD are extremely challenging due to disparate time and length scales, strong hyperbolic phenomena, and nonlinearity. Therefore the development of scalable, implicit MHD algorithms and high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement strategies is of considerable importance. We recently developed a high-order stabilized finite-element algorithm 1 for the reduced visco-resistive MHD equations based on MFEM . The scheme is fully implicit, solved with the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method with a physics-based preconditioning strategy. Our preconditioning strategy is a generalization of the physics-based preconditioning methods in [Chacon, et al, JCP 2002] to adaptive, stabilized finite elements. Algebraic multigrid methods are used to invert sub-block operators to achieve scalability. A parallel adaptive mesh refinement scheme with dynamic load-balancing is implemented to efficiently resolve the multi-scale spatial features of the system. The potential of the AMR approach is observed in an island coalescence problem in the high Lundquist-number regime ($\\ge 10^7$) with the successful resolution of plasmoid instabilities and thin current sheets.

Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations are continuum models used in the study of a wide range of plasma physics systems, including the evolution of complex plasma dynamics in tokamak disruptions. However, efficient numerical solution methods for MHD are extremely challenging due to disparate time and length scales, strong hyperbolic phenomena, and nonlinearity. Therefore the development of scalable, implicit MHD algorithms and high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement strategies is of considerable importance. We recently developed a high-order stabilized finite-element algorithm 1 for the reduced visco-resistive MHD equations based on MFEM . The scheme is fully implicit, solved with the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method with a physics-based preconditioning strategy. Our preconditioning strategy is a generalization of the physics-based preconditioning methods in [Chacon, et al, JCP 2002] to adaptive, stabilized finite elements. Algebraic multigrid methods are used to invert sub-block operators to achieve scalability. A parallel adaptive mesh refinement scheme with dynamic load-balancing is implemented to efficiently resolve the multi-scale spatial features of the system.

Jun 17, 2024 A new paper has been submitted on building a physics-assisted latent dynamics model for collisional-radiative models. This is a critical component in integrated modeling for fusion WDM. See OSTI . Our postdoc, Xuping Xie, is the lead author. Feb 24, 2024 A new paper has been submitted on building Fenichel normal form strongly into neural ODE. This is the first realization of Fenichel normal form in machine learning, opening a new path for studying multiscale dynamical systems. See arXiv . Our postdocs, Dan Serino and Allen Alvarez-Loya, are the lead authors.","title":"Team News"},{"location":"publications/","text":"Publications Preprints (available on Google Scholar or can be found on arXiv ) E.

These assignments will form the basis for in-class discussions, so it is important that you complete them. Class meetings Class meetings are meant to be highly interactive and you are expected to attend if possible. You must be able to bring a laptop computer to class and are expected to complete short programming assignments in class. Class management We will use Canvas and Github Classroom to deliver course materials, announcements, and manage the discussion board. All course materials will be hosted on Github Classroom. Graduate vs undergraduate sections Both the graduate and undergraduate sections will meet together for lectures. Students in the graduate and undergraduate sections will be graded on separate, independent grade scales. Graduate students will be assigned an additional independent mini project. In addition, for the final project, graduate student projects should have a stronger research component, aiming for results comparable to a conference or journal publication.
