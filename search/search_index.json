I build upon computational techiniques such as implicit time stepping, iterative methods, adavanced preconditioning, adaptive mesh refinement, domain decompositions, and GPU accelerations. Here two recent works are presented. Scalable MFEM-based resistive MHD solver LA-UR-22-22440. Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations are continuum models used in the study of a wide range of plasma physics systems, including the evolution of complex plasma dynamics in tokamak disruptions. However, efficient numerical solution methods for MHD are extremely challenging due to disparate time and length scales, strong hyperbolic phenomena, and nonlinearity. Therefore the development of scalable, implicit MHD algorithms and high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement strategies is of considerable importance. We recently developed a high-order stabilized finite-element algorithm 1 for the reduced visco-resistive MHD equations based on MFEM . The scheme is fully implicit, solved with the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method with a physics-based preconditioning strategy. Our preconditioning strategy is a generalization of the physics-based preconditioning methods in [Chacon, et al, JCP 2002] to adaptive, stabilized finite elements. Algebraic multigrid methods are used to invert sub-block operators to achieve scalability. A parallel adaptive mesh refinement scheme with dynamic load-balancing is implemented to efficiently resolve the multi-scale spatial features of the system. The potential of the AMR approach is observed in an island coalescence problem in the high Lundquist-number regime ($\\ge 10^7$) with the successful resolution of plasmoid instabilities and thin current sheets. Result Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. This simulation uses 6 levels of AMR refinement, H1 finite elements of 3rd order polynomials, physics-based preconditioning, and stabilized discretization on 1800 CPUs. The run is initialized with two magnetic islands and they collide into each other and form the current sheet. The movie zooms in the center of the entire simulation domain. Here it uses the Lundquist number of $10^6$. Therefore, the plasmoids start to appear around the thin current sheet at a later time, and those plasmoids are quickly ejected into the jet region in the top and bottom of the current sheet. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Zoomed-in view of the above run around the current sheet Domain decomposition at the intial time (left) and the final time (right) of the above run. A random number is assigned to each domain for visualization. Since a space filling curve is used for partitioning, the decompositions are mostly continuous througout the run. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. This simulation uses 7 levels of AMR refinement and the Lundquist number of $10^7$ instead. The run is also initialized with two magnetic islands and a very thin current sheet is forming in the center. Note that many plasmoids continuously appear around the current sheet particularly near the center of the domain (x point), and those plasmoids collide into each other and form a very complicated structure. Adaptive, scalable relativistic Fokker-Planck-Boltzmann solver based on PETSc-p4est LA-UR-22-22439. Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.

We developed a new data management framework in PETSc based on the p4est library that enables simulations with dynamic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), and implemented a new runaway electron solver that interfaces to the PETSc framework.

The simulation demonstrates the critical need for AMR 1 , in which 7 levels of refinement are used (corresponding to a 128 factor of resolution increase) to resolve both low-energy Maxwellian bulk and high-energy runaway tail.

Fast neural Poincar\u00e9 maps for toroidal magnetic fields Poincar\u00e9 maps for toroidal magnetic fields are routinely employed to study gross confinement properties in devices built to contain hot plasmas. In most practical applications, evaluating a Poincar\u00e9 map requires numerical integration of a magnetic field line, a process that can be slow and that cannot be easily accelerated using parallel computations. We propose a novel neural network architecture, the H\u00e9nonNet 1 , and show that it is capable of accurately learning realistic Poincar\u00e9 maps from observations of a conventional field-line-following algorithm. After training, such learned Poincar\u00e9 maps evaluate much faster than the field-line integration method. Moreover, the H\u00e9nonNet architecture exactly reproduces the primary physics constraint imposed on field-line Poincar\u00e9 maps: flux preservation. This structure-preserving property is the consequence of each layer in a H\u00e9nonNet being a symplectic map. We demonstrate empirically that a H\u00e9nonNet can learn to mock the confinement properties of a large magnetic island by using coiled hyperbolic invariant manifolds to produce a sticky chaotic region at the desired island location. This suggests a novel approach to designing magnetic fields with good confinement properties that may be more flexible than ensuring confinement using KAM tori.

In most practical applications, evaluating a Poincar\u00e9 map requires numerical integration of a magnetic field line, a process that can be slow and that cannot be easily accelerated using parallel computations. We propose a novel neural network architecture, the H\u00e9nonNet 1 , and show that it is capable of accurately learning realistic Poincar\u00e9 maps from observations of a conventional field-line-following algorithm. After training, such learned Poincar\u00e9 maps evaluate much faster than the field-line integration method. Moreover, the H\u00e9nonNet architecture exactly reproduces the primary physics constraint imposed on field-line Poincar\u00e9 maps: flux preservation. This structure-preserving property is the consequence of each layer in a H\u00e9nonNet being a symplectic map. We demonstrate empirically that a H\u00e9nonNet can learn to mock the confinement properties of a large magnetic island by using coiled hyperbolic invariant manifolds to produce a sticky chaotic region at the desired island location. This suggests a novel approach to designing magnetic fields with good confinement properties that may be more flexible than ensuring confinement using KAM tori.
