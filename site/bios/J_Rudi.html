 <a href="https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~jrudi"><b>Johann Rudi</b></a> (he) is an Argonne Scholar at Argonne National Laboratory's Mathematics and Computer Science division.  Previously, he graduated with a Ph.D. in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics at The University of Texas at Austin; advisors: Prof. Omar Ghattas (he) and Prof. Georg Stadler (he).  Prior to joining The University of Texas, he graduated from the Paderborn University in Germany with the German Diploma degree in a multi-disciplinary program called Techno-Mathematics (the Diploma is comparable to a Master's degree with thesis); advisor: Prof. Angela Kunoth (she).
His research is interdisciplinary and spans computational aspects of inverse problems (e.g., estimating parameters in physical models governed by ordinary/partial differential equations), quantification of uncertainties in the inferred parameters, large-scale parallel iterative methods for nonlinear and linear systems, and development and implementation of algorithms for high-performance computing (HPC) platforms.  Specifically, he has worked on adjoint-based, sampling-based, and machine learning-based methods for inference, as well as parallel multigrid and Schur complement approximation techniques for nonlinear Stokes equations.  His work has been recognized by honors including the Argonne Wilkinson Fellowship, the George Michael Memorial HPC Fellowship, and the Gordon Bell Prize.
<!-- He has been collaborating with mathematicians, data scientists, and domain scientists, such as, geophysicists (Earth's mantle convection models), physicists (relativistic electron models), neuroscientists (spiking neuron models), and computer scientists (HPC). -->
