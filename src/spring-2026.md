## Course description
This course introduces fundamental algorithms in numerical linear algebra, including methods for solving linear systems, constructing orthogonal bases, and computing eigenvalue and singular value decompositions (SVD). A key objective is to prepare Ph.D. students for the qualifying exam; therefore, the course emphasizes theorems, proofs, and the mathematical principles underlying these algorithms.
## Prerequisites
* MATH 2406 or MATH 4305 
* MATH 4640 is not required but strongly recommended

## Topics
* Problem conditioning, perturbation theory
* Stability, error analysis
* Floating point computation, parallel computation
* Computational complexity of algorithms
* SVD, QR, and other orthogonal factorizations
* Solving linear least squares problems, including rank deficient problems
* Gaussian elimination
* Iterative methods and their convergence for solving linear systems (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, etc.)
* Eigenvalue problems and their solution (symmetric and nonsymmetric)
* Krylov subspace methods for eigenvalues and linear systems (Lanczos, Arnoldi, CG, GMRES)

## Grading
The weights for the course grade are as follows. Students must pass the final exam to pass the course.

Category      | %
--------------|----
Homework      | 30% 
Midterms      | 30% 
Final         | 40% 

The final course grade will be assigned based on the following scale.

Grade        |  %
------------ | ----------
A            | 90-100%
B            | 80-89%
C            | 70-79%
D            | 60-69%
F            | 0-59%

### Pass/Fail and Audit

For pass/fail, the passing grade is 50% and you are strongly encouraged to attend class regularly. If you wish to take the course for audit credit, the audit credit is given for a grade of at least 20% and you are strongly encouraged to attend class regularly.

## Textbooks
* Numerical Linear Algebra, Trefethen and Bau. <br>
_This is a very clearly written textbook, and we will cover the entire book. You can order this book from SIAM. You can get a 30 percent discount if you are a SIAM member. As a student, you can join SIAM for free, since Georgia Tech is an Academic Member._



### Additional references:
* Matrix Computations, Golub and Van Loan. _This is the bible of numerical linear algebra. Advanced material will be taken from this book._
* Applied Numerical Linear Algebra, Demmel. _This is another classic textbook._
* [The Matrix Cookbook](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~ece602/MISC/matrixcookbook.pdf), Petersen and Pedersen. _This online book contains many important identities and is incredibly useful._

## Homework Policy
All homework is due by the EOD (11:59pm). Homework is penalized by 20% for each day it is late (this
applies additively, meaning that no credit is gained after five late days). We strongly encourage the use
of LaTeX for your submission. Unreadable handwriting is subject to zero credit.


## Class management
We will use Canvas to deliver course materials and announcements.

## Course policies, expectations & guidelines

### Plagiarism & academic integrity

Georgia Tech aims to cultivate a community based on trust, academic integrity, and honor. Students are expected to act according to the highest ethical standards. For more information on the Honor Code, please visit the [OSI](https://osi.gatech.edu/) website.

We encourage you to discuss course content and homework problems with your classmates. However,
all answers and codes should be prepared independently. If you refer to any material, it should be
properly cited. Needless to say: you are not allowed to use solutions to homework problems that you
may find online. If you discussed homework problems with your classmates, indicate which problems
you discussed with whom. 

Any student suspected of cheating or plagiarizing on a quiz, exam, or assignment will be reported to the Office of Student Integrity, which will investigate the incident and identify the appropriate penalty for violations. 

### Role of AI assistants
The use of LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini will be treated like a human collaborator: You have to indicate their use,
what you used them for, and you may only use them to get ideas in trying to figure out the solution of a
problem or resolve places where you might have gotten stuck. Like a human collaborator, you should not use the LLMs when preparing your solutions or code. For instance, directly copying the output of a chatbot is strictly forbidden

### Accommodations for individuals with disabilities

If you are a student with learning needs that require special accommodation, contact the Office of Disability Services at (404) 894-2563 or [website](http://disabilityservices.gatech.edu/), as soon as possible, to make an appointment to discuss your special needs and to obtain an accommodations letter.  Please also email me as soon as possible in order to set up a time to discuss your learning needs.

### Student-faculty expectations

The Georgia Tech community believes that it is important to continually strive for an atmosphere of mutual respect, acknowledgement, and responsibility between faculty members and the student body. Therefore, we herein endeavors to enumerate the specific expectations of each side. See [here](https://catalog.gatech.edu/rules/21/) for more details.
