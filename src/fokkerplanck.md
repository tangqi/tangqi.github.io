## Overview

We consider a 0D2V relativistic Fokker-Planck equation for runaway electrons 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}  - eE_\parallel \left(\xi\frac{\partial f}{\partial p} + \frac{1-\xi^2}{p} \frac{\partial f}{\partial\xi} \right) = C_{\rm col}(f) + C_{\rm rad}(f) + C_{\rm Chiu}(f),
\end{align}
where $C_{\rm col}(f)$ is a Columbo collision operator, $C_{\rm rad}(f)$ a radiation damping operator,
and $C_{\rm Chiu}(f)$ is a secondary knock on collision source.
We develop a scalable fully implicit solver with dynamic adaptivity. We developed a new data management framework in [PETSc](https://petsc.org) based on the [p4est](https://p4est.org) library that enables simulations with dynamic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), and implemented a new runaway electron solver that interfaces to the PETSc framework.

*The simulation demonstrates the critical need for AMR[^1], in which 7 levels of refinement are used (corresponding to a 128 factor of resolution increase) to resolve both low-energy Maxwellian bulk and high-energy runaway tail. The dynamic AMR successfully captures the interaction between two structures and resolves a forming vortex structure. A delta-function-like Chiu source and practical collision parameters extracted from ITER are also deployed.*
