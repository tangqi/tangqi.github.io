Oct 16, 2024 | A new paper has been submitted on a structure-preserving discontinuous Galerkin scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard equation. We designed and developed the new scheme using a combination of compatible finite elements, fully implicit time stepping, preconditioning, and time adaptivity. This is a joint work with Golo Wimmer and Ben Southworth at LANL. See [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13087).
Sep 24, 2024 | A new paper has been submitted on runaway electrons through wave-wave and wave-particle interactions. Using LANL's flagship VPIC code, We conducted large-scale Particle-In-Cell simulations to discover new physics related slow-X modes. This is a joint work with several physicists at LANL. See [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15830).
Aug 29, 2024 | Our postdoc, Dan Serino, has accepted an offer to become a Staff Scientist at T-5. He will continue as a collaborator of our team, with his research focusing on machine learning, applied math, and computational science at LANL. Congratulations, Dan!
Aug 20, 2024 | Qi Tang has started a new position as a tenure-track assistant professor in the School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. At Georgia Tech, our team will continously explore high-performance computing, scientific computing and simulation, and AI/ML, three core research areas at CSE.
Aug 16, 2024  | After nearly six fruitful years at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), our team will be leaving T-5 and LANL. It has been a remarkable journey collaborating with some of the worldâ€™s best computational scientists, mathematicians, and physicists at Department of Energy national labs. We especially thank our collaborators from LANL, LLNL, SNL, and ANL for many helpful discussions.
Aug 8, 2024 | Our postdoc, Xuping Xie, has started a new position as a tenure-track assistant professor in Department of Mathematics and Statistics and School of Data Science at Old Dominion University. Congratulations!
Jul 3, 2024 | A new paper has been submitted on an adaptive Newton-based method for the free-boundary Grad-Shafranov equation. This solver provides an accurate low-beta initial condition for whole device modeling (WDM) in magnetic confinement fusion. See [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03499). Our postdoc, Dan Serino, is the lead author.
Jun 17, 2024 | A new paper has been submitted on building a physics-assisted latent dynamics model for collisional-radiative models. This is a critical component in integrated modeling for fusion WDM. See [OSTI](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2377685/). Our postdoc, Xuping Xie, is the lead author.
Feb 24, 2024 | A new paper has been submitted  on building Fenichel normal form strongly into neural ODE. This is the first realization of Fenichel normal form in machine learning, opening a new path for studying multiscale dynamical systems. See [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15839).  Our postdocs, Dan Serino and Allen Alvarez-Loya, are the lead authors.
