I am an Assistant Professor in [CSE](https://cse.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Institute of Technology. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I was a Scientist in the Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics Group ([T-5](https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/applied-mathematics-plasma-physics/index.php)) within the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). 

<!-- Prior to that, from 2015 to 2018, I was an Eliza Ricketts Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I received my Ph.D. in Applied Math from Michigan State University in 2015 and B.S. in Math & Applied Math from Zhejiang University in 2010. -->


I am a computational scientist and applied mathematician by training, with a strong interest in physics. My research focuses on applying modern computational tools to advance physics applications, particularly in fusion energy and plasma physics. I rely on open-source libraries such as  [`MFEM`](https://mfem.org/), [`PETSc`](https://petsc.org/), [`p4est`](https://www.p4est.org/), [`Overture`](https://www.overtureframework.org/), and [`hypre`](https://hypre.readthedocs.io/) to develop scalable, high-performance simulation codes. I am also exploring scientific machine learning (SciML) to enhance traditional numerical methods. My group’s work has been supported by the DOE Office of Science (ASCR, FES, and their joint SciDAC program), NNSA, LANL and SNL LDRD programs, NSF, NASA, and Georgia Tech.

<b>
<span style="color:#003057">I have several PhD student positions in Fall 2026. The Ph.D. projects can involve one or multiple areas from the research interests listed below. Some of the positions will be co-advised with Brown Unversity, Courant Institute, and Michigan State. If there is sufficient interest, students can undertake a summer internship at one of the DOE national labs. If you are interested in joining my group, please email me with your CV. </span>

<span style="color:#003057">
Please note that Ph.D. students in the CSE program can have a home unit in a different school. Therefore, I am also interested in accepting students in mathematics, physics, and engineering. However, students must first be admitted by their respective home units. Therefore, if you are strongly interested in working with me, I encourage you to select CSE as your home unit.</span>

<!-- **Address:** School of Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332.
*Due to the nature of the physics and math problems I work on, algorithm development typically requires a year or more of effort. As a result, I do not offer short-term internship positions.*
