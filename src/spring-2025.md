## Course Description
This course covers the practical and theoretical aspects of parallel computing and their applications. It will focus on OpenMPI, MPI, GPU programming (CUDA), practical tools, and scientific applications such as particle-based simulations.

## Prerequisites
* Proficiency in C/C++ programming
* CS 1332, 1372, 2110 or CX 4010
* Some basic knowledge in Linux

## Topics
* Overview of single processor computing
* Introduction to git and PACE
* Parallel programming and theory
* Distributed memory (MPI) programming
* Multithreaded (OpenMP) programming
* GPU (CUDA) programming
* Practical tools and scientific applications (debugger, Kokkos, PETSc, Cabanna, etc)	

## Grading
The weights for the course grade are as follows.

Category      | %
--------------|----
Mini-Projects (during the semester) | 60% 
Final Project (due during exam week) | 30% 
Class participation         | 10% 

The final course grade will be assigned based on the following scale.

Grade        |  %
------------ | ----------
A            | 90-100%
B            | 80-89%
C            | 70-79%
D            | 60-69%
F            | 0-59%

## Pre-class Assignments
For most class meetings, there will be a pre-class assignment that you should complete beforehand. These assignments will form the basis for in-class discussions, so it is important that you complete them.

## Class Meetings
Class meetings are meant to be highly interactive and you are expected to attend if possible. You must be able to bring a laptop computer to class and are expected to complete short programming assignments in class.

## Class Management
We will use Canvas to deliver course materials, announcements, and manage the discussion board. All course materials will be hosted on Canvas.
